# lunch-pail
[lunch-pail](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/lunch-pail) is a .NET Standard compliant Unit of Work implementation for ADO.NET. The UoW is the workhorse of the data context, so the project was dubbed "lunch pail" as a reference to blue collar athletes.

I decided to package this into an assembly because I got tired of copying it from project to project.
